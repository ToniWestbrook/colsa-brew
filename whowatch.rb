    # "false" with the main program this formula installs, but it'd be nice if you
    # were more thorough. Run the test with `brew test whowatch`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.

    # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
    # executables being tested: `system "#{bin}/program", "do", "something"`.
